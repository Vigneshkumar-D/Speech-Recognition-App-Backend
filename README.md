## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Backend functionality includes speech recognition using the Web Speech API.
- **Excel File Generation:** Transcribed text is saved to an Excel file for further analysis and use.
- **RESTful APIs:** The backend exposes RESTful APIs for receiving transcription data and handling requests.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle unexpected scenarios and provide informative error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for building web applications with Java.
- **Apache POI:** Library for working with Microsoft Office documents, used for Excel file generation.
